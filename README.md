# Gajarakshak – AI & IoT Based Human–Elephant Conflict Prevention System

## Overview
Gajarakshak is an intelligent AI and IoT based system designed to prevent human–elephant conflicts by enabling early detection and real-time alert generation. The system combines computer vision, sensor fusion, and edge computing to monitor elephant movement near human settlements, farms, and forest boundaries.

The system focuses on eco-friendly, non-harmful deterrent techniques while enabling rapid response from forest authorities.

## Objectives
- Detect elephant presence using AI-based vision and sensor data
- Provide early warning alerts to prevent human-wildlife conflict
- Enable real-time monitoring in remote and low-connectivity areas
- Support forest officials with automated alert and monitoring systems
- Promote safe and sustainable wildlife conservation methods

---

## System Architecture
The Gajarakshak system follows a hybrid Edge AI and IoT architecture:

1. Multi-sensor data acquisition
2. Edge-based AI processing
3. Communication and alert transmission
4. Monitoring dashboard and response system
